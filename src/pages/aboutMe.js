            <p css={css`text-indent: 1.2rem; line-height: 2;`}>Before attending the University of Central Florida where I am currently studying 
                                                             computer science, I was studying computer networking at Atlantic Technical College 
                                                             & High School. It was here that I also took my first computer science courses and began 
                                                             to enjoy solving coding problems and working on my coding projects. It was safe to say 
                                                             that I knew what I wanted to major in. Shortly after graduation, I began to work on even
                                                             more personal projects to learn as much as I could before I had even taken my first college 
                                                             class. I also began to work on more complicated coding problems that required me to learn and 
                                                             implement data structures (ex. LinkedList and HashMap) that I had no previous knowledge of before. 
                                                             Once it was time to begin fall classes I was excited not just to see how much I could learn in a
                                                             short amount of time, but also to join the CS community on campus through clubs and organizations, 
                                                             specifically our schoolâ€™s international collegiate programming team and our Association for Computing
